## Galaxy and its community

The Freiburg Galaxy team is highly involved in many projects of the Galaxy community:

- Galaxy core development and maintenance
- Tool integration into Galaxy and their maintenance through
    - [Intergalactic Utilities Commission](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/)
    - [Björn's repository](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools)
- [Galaxy Training Material](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/), a collection of Galaxy-related tutorials and its infrastructure, developed and maintained by the community
- [Galaxy Docker](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable) to provide an easy distributable full-fledged Galaxy installation
- Development and maintenance of different Galaxy flavours
    - [RNA-Workbench](https://bgruening.github.io/galaxy-rna-workbench/) 
    - [ASaiM](https://asaim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for metagenomics
- Jupyter integration into Galaxy
- [GalaxyP](http://galaxyp.org) - a Galaxy communitity dedicated to develop [tools](https://github.com/galaxyproteomics/tools-galaxyp), workflows and [training material](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/proteomics/) for Proteomic research.
- [Galaxy Genome Annotation](https://galaxy-genome-annotation.github.io/) (GGA) is a group of projects focused on supporting genome annotation inside Galaxy

## Bioconda and Biocontainers

Spending valuable time in compilation/installation hell should not be a problem nowadays. Therefore, the Freiburg Galaxy team is leading the [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io) and [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro) projects, which together form the best stack for reproducible science ever.

Bioconda is a channel for the conda package manager specializing in bioinformatics with more than 3,000 bioinformatics packages ready to use with `conda install`. BioContainers is an open source and community-driven framework which provides system-agnostic executable environments for bioinformatics software, with more than 3,000 containers ready to use.

## de.NBI and ELIXIR

The Freiburg Galaxy team is part of [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/), the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure, through the [RNA Bioinformatics Center](https://www.denbi.de/rbc). Via de.NBI, the Freiburg Galaxy team is also involved in [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org), as technical coordinator for the the [German node](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/germany).

The Freiburg Galaxy team is also co-leading the [ELIXIR Galaxy Community
](https://www.elixir-europe.org/communities/galaxy), particularly with the maintenance of European Galaxy instance: [https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu).

## SFB 992

As part of the [Collaborative Research Centre 992](https://www.sfb992.uni-freiburg.de/
) - Medical Epigenetics, we are helping researchers from to analyse their epigentic data. As part of this we are developing and maintaining together with [Group of Thomas Make](https://www.ie-freiburg.mpg.de/de/bioinformaticsfac) from MPI-IE deepTools and [HiCExplorer](https://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io).

## MIRACUM

[MIRACUM ((Medical Informatics for Research and Care in University Medicine))](https://www.miracum.org) – this is eight universities with eight university hospitals, two universities of applied sciences and one industrial partner spread over five German states - and we are one of them! :)
As part of the MTB use-case we are developing and maintaining together with [Melanie Börries](https://www.mol-med.uni-freiburg.de/mom/boerries) the EXOM-seq pipeline in Galaxy.
