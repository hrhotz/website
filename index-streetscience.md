# Street Science Community
### Bring science to the "street"


Welcome to a **Galaxy dedicated for the [Street Science Community](https://streetscience.community/){:target="_blank"}**.

## Get started

Are you new to Galaxy, or returning after a long time, and looking for help to get started? Take [a guided tour](https://metagenomics.usegalaxy.eu/tours/core.galaxy_ui){:target="_blank"} through Galaxy's user interface.

## What is the Street Science community?

In the Street Science community, we want to make science tangible & accessible by bringing it to the "street" via open science workshops. Our first project is [BeerDEcoded](https://streetscience.community/projects/beerdecoded/){:target="_blank"}, sequencing the DNA of beer. 

Beer is alive! It contains DNA that comes from its ingredients (hops, malts, yeast) and some hundred microbes. There are 1,000+ yeasts used for brewing and 200+ hop varieties, each one bearing a different DNA and contributing to differentiate its properties.

We use the beer to sensibilize the public to molecular biology and genomic related research, DNA sequencing and data analysis and the challenges and possibilities that genomics brings to our society.
