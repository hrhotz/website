The Freiburg Galaxy Team has a wide variety of active projects where you could be involved in. Our [current areas of expertise]({% link freiburg/services.md %}) include:

- **Distributed computing and systems programming**

    We are engaged in the development of workflow systems, cloud computing based solutions, and other projects involving high performance and data intensive computing.

- **Web-based visualization and visual analytics**

    We are building web interfaces for visual analysis of large data analysis that leverage cutting edge web technologies.

- **Informatics and big data analysis and integration**

    We build and use tools to analyze large datasets generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing to understand genomes and genome function.

- **Bioinformatics application areas** such as transcriptomics, epigenetics,metagenomics and genome-annotation.

- **Machine learning and cheminformatics**

    We want to make machine learning and cheminformatics more accessible and reproducible.

- **Linux containers technologies and software management with conda**

    We are heavily involved in Bioconda and BioContainers to build the new scientific stack for reproducible research.

- **Train the next generation of data scientists**

    We aim to democratize bioinformatics infrastructure and knowledge. We are passionate about training and education across the world.

- **Building the European Life-Science Infrastructure**

    The European Galaxy project is part of [de.NBI](), ELIXIR and EOSC to build a sustainable and transparent research platform.
