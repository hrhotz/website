  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p>
    The maintenance and administration of UseGalaxy.eu is done primarily by the
    Freiburg Galaxy Team, an academic group. We work together with other academic
    groups across Europe and with the US Galaxy team.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We make a <i>best effort</i> to provide high uptime. Please see our [status page](https://status.galaxyproject.org) for more information.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Freiburg Team tries to maintain a balance between service uptime and
    <a href="https://github.com/hexylena/presentations/blob/master/2018-04-retreat/main.pdf">the health of the administrators behind the service.</a>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes we are able to achieve this, sometimes due to factors outside
    our control, our service is temporarily inaccessible.
