UseGalaxy.eu is currently facing some issues with tools execution and it may take us a while to find a solution.  
If you get an error message of this kind:  
`Parent instance <ToolShedRepository at 0x7fe3f20dca10> is not bound to a Session; lazy load operation of attribute 'tool_dependencies' cannot proceed (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/bhk3)`

we suggest trying to rerun your failed job until its execution succeeds.  
This may also be the perfect time to start enjoying your weekend!


Sorry for the inconvenience.
