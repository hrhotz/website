This event is the key community-building and networking event in [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), an organization teaching foundational computational, coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide. Bérénice was there to represent Galaxy and the Freiburg Galaxy team.

The event started with 2 days (May 28-29) of [Computational Skills for Data Analysis (Data Carpentry) workshop](https://malvikasharan.github.io/2018-05-28-Dublin/). Bérénice, with Jason Williams and Malvika Sharan, trained there: Data Organization, Cloud Genomics, Introduction to Command line and R for Genomics.

The conference per se started on Wednesday. The theme of the conference was "Building Locally, Connecting Globally", a theme that was really present during the whole conference. It started with a first keynote speach "Focus on Allies" by [Valeria Aurora](http://valerieaurora.org/), which taught us all some new strategies to support diversity and inclusion. It was followed by a story Circle Icebreaker and some time for networking.
