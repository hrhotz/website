The Galaxy community is developing and maintaining a collection of tutorials that are designed to be interactive and are built around Galaxy: [https://training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org). To help highlight our tutorials and the training effort of the community, a member of the community will select every month one tutorial and explains in the *Galactic Blog* why they select this tutorial. This month, the [Galaxy contributor of the Month!](https://galaxyproject.org/blog/2018-10-totm/2018-10-cotm-yvan-le-bras), Yvan Le Bras, selects and presents a tutorial: ["Galaxy 101"](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-101/tutorial.html), from the topic ["Introduction to Galaxy Analyses"](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/introduction/)
