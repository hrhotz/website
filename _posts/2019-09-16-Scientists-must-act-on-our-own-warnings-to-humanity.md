From a recent [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0979-y):

> We face interconnected planetary emergencies threatening our climate and ecosystems. Charlie J. Gardner and Claire F. R. Wordley argue that scientists should join civil disobedience movements to fight these unprecedented crises.

> Non-violent civil disobedience — the active refusal of a citizen to obey certain laws, orders or commands of a government or occupying power — is demonstrably effective at initiating political change. Many of the most profound political and social changes of the past century were brought about in this way, and leading practitioners, such as Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst, Martin Luther King and Mohandas Ghandi, once reviled as dangerous dissenters, are today revered as heroes. Moreover, civil disobedience requires relatively few people to be effective, with sustained action by __3.5%__ of the population sufficient even to topple dictatorial regimes (E. Chenoweth and M. J. Stephan, Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict; Columbia Univ. Press, 2012).
