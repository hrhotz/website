Our paper "Bioconda: A sustainable and comprehensive software distribution for the life sciences", written with the **great and *big*** [BioConda](https://bioconda.github.io/) community, is now available as preprint on [bioRXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/21/207092).

## Abstract

We present [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io), a distribution of bioinformatics software for the lightweight, multi-platform and language-agnostic package manager, Conda. Currently, Bioconda offers a collection of over 2900 software tools, which are continuously maintained, updated, and extended by a growing global community of more than 200 contributors. Bioconda improves analysis reproducibility by allowing users to define isolated environments with defined software versions, all of which are easily installed and managed without administrative privileges.
