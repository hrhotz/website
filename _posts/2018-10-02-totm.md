The Galaxy community is developing and maintaining a collection of tutorials that are designed to be interactive and are built around Galaxy: [https://training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org). To help highlight our tutorials and the training effort of the community, a member of the community will select every month one tutorial and explains in the *Galactic Blog* why they select this tutorial. This month Maria Doyle has selected the tutorial ["From peaks to genes"](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-peaks2genes/tutorial.html), from the topic "Introduction to Galaxy Analyses".
