This tool is special in multiple ways. At first its one of the few tools that only runs in a very special Container, created by Dr. Matt Chambers, including
[Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and [Proteowizard](http://www.proteowizard.org/). This is because many of the underlying libraries do need a Windows runtime environment
and Matt found a way to make this available in a Container so Galaxy Europe and all others can use it on there Cloud systems.

Because [msconvert](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/msconvert/msconvert/3.0.19052.0){:target="_blank"} is part of
[Proteowizard](http://www.proteowizard.org/) you need to agree with the [vendor licenses](http://www.proteowizard.org/licenses.html) before you can use this tool.
