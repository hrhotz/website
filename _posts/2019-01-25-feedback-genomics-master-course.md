This semester, the [Faculty of Biology at the University of Belgrade](http://bg.ac.rs/en/members/faculties/FB.php){:target="_blank"} offered for the first time
an elective master course **Introduction to Genomics** which included several hands-on sessions on the Galaxy platform.

Lectures in this course were open to everyone and soon after the hands-on sessions
started, several PhD students joined the 8 master students attending the course. During the classes we worked on RNA-seq analyses and variant calling.

Students were interested and deeply engaged. In the end, this first generation completed the course
with excellent marks and was (based on their feedback) satisfied with the perspective in data science
that Galaxy has opened to them.

The European Galaxy project team was very helpful in providing the training resources (via [TIaaS](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas))
and in responding to our questions. Thank you!
