We recently had the privilege of using the usegalaxy.eu's new [Training
infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS)](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas) for our course on "Introduction to
Galaxy and RNA-seq" at the [Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre](https://www.petermac.org) in Melbourne,
Australia. Our own infrastructure was undergoing an upgrade and our
planned workshop was going to be delayed but thanks to the TIaaS we were
able to go ahead and run our workshop. All went smoothly and the feedback
was very positive with 100% saying they would recommend the course to
colleagues. A big thanks to the Galaxy EU team for providing this great
resource.
