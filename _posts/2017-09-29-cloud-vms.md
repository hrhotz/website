title: "VGCN: Rolling Replacement of Cloud Compute Resources"
---

We have been experimentally running some Galaxy jobs in the bwCloud at the
University of Freiburg. Unlike more traditional compute resources we can scale
the cloud resources up and down on-demand.

But what happens when we need to replace the VMs? We built a new version of
our compute node images but we didn't want to disrupt jobs that were running.

So we spent some time developing a small tool to gracefully terminate the VMs
running the old image and replace them with VMs running the new image.
