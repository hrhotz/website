This week [we](/freiburg/people) are celebrating 5 million jobs and 5 thousand users.
Since we opened the Galaxy server to the public a year ago we got 4000 new users and every 2 minutes a job finishes.
This would not be possible without the support of [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/), [ELIXIR](http://elixir-europe.org/),
[EOSC](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud) and the Freiburg [Faculty of Medicine](http://www.med.uni-freiburg.de).

Thanks to all our users and people that have contributed to this project! Special thankts our partner sites [Erasmus MC](https://galaxyproject.eu/erasmusmc/),
[Belgium](https://galaxyproject.eu/vib/) and [Pasteur](https://galaxyproject.eu/pasteur/) and the [Galaxy community](https://galaxyproject.org/community/).
