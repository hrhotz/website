As you probably know GCC2019 will be held in Freiburg, Germany, from 1-6 July.
Like [previous Galaxy Community Conferences](https://galaxyproject.org/gcc/),
GCC2019 will [feature](https://gcc2019.sched.com) keynotes, accepted talks, posters, and demos,
birds-of-a-feather gatherings, multiple days of collaborative work, and plenty of
opportunities to network with your fellow data-intensive researchers and practitioners.
If you are working in data-intensive life science, there is no better place to be.
