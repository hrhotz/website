We have started to test a few of our workflows automatically against [UseGalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu).
This will run all workflows monthly to ensure that the keep working and that our infrastructure works and scales well.

Feel free to contribute workflows to our [testing repository](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/workflow-testing) or
propose us workflows via [opening an issue](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/workflow-testing/issues/new). Alternatively you can write us at [contact@usegalaxy.eu](mailto:contact@usegalaxy.eu). If you would like us to test these workflows on your server, just get in contact with us and we can do that as well.
