Last week we got a request from on of our users with a tricky question:

> I need a tool that:
> - reads two files (`parent`, and `subset`)
> - I need to pick out random lines from the `parent`
>    - but it should ignore lines in the `subset`.
> And the number of random lines to be picked should be equal to the number of lines in the subset file.

Any idea how to solve that? It is possible with the normal Galaxy tools :)

We proposed the following solution:

  1. ["Join two files"](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_easyjoin_tool/)
  to filter out the lines that are in the `subset` file __and__ the `parent` file. You should have now a new `parent` file without those line from the `subset`.

  2. ["Sort"](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_sort_header_tool/)
  the new file with the option `Random order (-R)`. Sort has indeed a random sorting option, somehow unintuitive - but useful.<br>
  Now we have a random sorted file without the unwanted lines. What needs to be done is to extract N lines, where N is the length of the `subset` file.

  3. ["Add column to an existing dataset"](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=addValue) with the `iterate` option enabled. This you need to do
  for both files the initial `subset` file and the new random sorted partent from step 2.

  4. Now use ["Join two files"](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_easyjoin_tool/)
  again, but this time on the newly created datasets with the additional column. This will give you exactly N lines where N is the amount of
  lines in the `subset` file.

  5. (Optional) If needed, remove the additional column with the [Cut tool](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_cut_tool/1.1.0).
