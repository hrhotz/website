The Freiburg Galaxy Team is striking tomorrow the [20th of September](https://globalclimatestrike.net).
We will be joining the [Scientists for Future](https://www.scientists4future.org) and the
[Global Climate Strike](https://globalclimatestrike.net) organised in Freiburg.

We encourage all our users to schedule the workflows today and
join one of [the hundreds of strikes](https://globalclimatestrike.net/#map) world-wide tomorrow.
