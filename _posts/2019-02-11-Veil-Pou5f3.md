## Abstract

The zebrafish embryo is mostly transcriptionally quiescent during the first 10 cell cycles,
until the main wave of Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) occurs, accompanied by fast chromatin remodeling.
At ZGA, homologs of mammalian stem cell transcription factors (TFs) Pou5f3, Nanog and Sox19b
bind to thousands of developmental enhancers to initiate transcription. So far, how these
TFs influence chromatin dynamics at ZGA has remained unresolved. To address this question,
we analyzed nucleosome positions in wild-type and Maternal-Zygotic (MZ) mutants for pou5f3
and nanog by MNase-seq. We show that Nanog, Sox19b, and Pou5f3 bind to the High Nucleosome
Affinity Regions (HNARs). HNARs are spanning over 600 bp, featuring high in vivo and
predicted in vitro nucleosome occupancy and high predicted propeller twist DNA shape value.
We suggest a two-step nucleosome destabilization-depletion model, where the same intrinsic
DNA properties of HNAR promote both high nucleosome occupancy and differential binding of
TFs. In the first step, already prior to ZGA, Pou5f3 and Nanog destabilize nucleosomes on
HNAR centers genome-wide. In the second step, post-ZGA, Nanog, Pou5f3, and SoxB1 maintain
open chromatin state on the subset of HNARs, acting synergistically. Nanog binds to the
HNAR center, while the Pou5f3 stabilizes the flanks. The HNAR model will provide a useful
tool for genome regulatory studies in the variety of biological systems.
