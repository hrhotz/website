## Abstract

**Rationale:** Structural and electrophysiological remodeling of the atria are recognized consequences of
sustained atrial arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation. The identification of underlying key molecules
and signaling pathways has been challenging because of the changing cell type composition during structural
remodeling of the atria.

**Objective:** Thus, the aims of our study were (1) to search for transcription factors and downstream
target genes, which are involved in atrial structural remodeling, (2) to characterize the significance
of the transcription factor ETV1 (E twenty-six variant 1) in atrial remodeling and arrhythmia, and (3)
to identify ETV1-dependent gene regulatory networks in atrial cardiac myocytes.

**Methods and results:** The transcription factor ETV1 was significantly upregulated in atrial tissue from patients with permanent
atrial fibrillation. Mice with cardiac myocyte-specific overexpression of ETV1 under control of the myosin
heavy chain promoter developed atrial dilatation, fibrosis, thrombosis, and arrhythmia. Cardiac myocyte-specific
ablation of ETV1 in mice did not alter cardiac structure and function at baseline.
Treatment with Ang II (angiotensin II) for 2 weeks elicited atrial remodeling
and fibrosis in control, but not in ETV1-deficient mice. To identify ETV1-regulated genes,
cardiac myocytes were isolated and purified from mouse atrial tissue. Active cis-regulatory
elements in mouse atrial cardiac myocytes were identified by chromatin accessibility
(assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing) and the active chromatin modification
H3K27ac (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing). One hundred seventy-eight genes
regulated by Ang II in an ETV1-dependent manner were associated with active
cis-regulatory elements containing ETV1-binding sites.
Various genes involved in Ca2+ handling or gap junction formation
( Ryr2, Jph2, Gja5), potassium channels ( Kcnh2, Kcnk3), and genes implicated in atrial fibrillation
( Tbx5) were part of this ETV1-driven gene regulatory network. The atrial ETV1-dependent transcriptome
in mice showed a significant overlap with the human atrial proteome of patients with permanent atrial fibrillation.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies ETV1 as an important component in the pathophysiology
of atrial remodeling associated with atrial arrhythmias.
