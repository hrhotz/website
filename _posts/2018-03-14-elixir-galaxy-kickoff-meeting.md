The meeting started with some talks from the [ViCE project](https://www.rz.uni-freiburg.de/rz/aktuell/vice-gestartet) and bwLehrPool.

After, many discussions followed about our priorities for the next years as a community, the usegalaxy.* servers, AAI authentication, etc. The minutes of the discussions are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d4Gstd47Gcz-K6jX190WeyO0QSoYNbYVE2a3BHn5zFA/edit?usp=sharing).
