[Dave B](https://galaxyproject.org/people/dave-bouvier/) pointed us to this nice article about
"Exploring the Effects of Spaceflight on Mouse Physiology using the Open Access NASA GeneLab Platform".

The "Open Access NASA GeneLab Platform" is a Galaxy instance and they referencing the [Galaxy Project Training Material](http://training.galaxyproject.org/).

NASA and Galaxy Project - what a nice match!
