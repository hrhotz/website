Recently we ran another Galaxy workshop using UseGalaxy.eu's Training infrastructure as a Service [(TIaaS)](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas). The workshop was an "Introduction to Galaxy and RNA-seq" run over two afternoons at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia. The attendees were a mix of students and postdocs and their feedback was good, they liked the hands-on, practical nature of the course. Thanks to the Galaxy EU team for enabling the course through providing the convenience of the TIaaS service.
