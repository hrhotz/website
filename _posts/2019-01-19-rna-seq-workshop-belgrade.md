This 2 day workshop was organized and hosted by the [Institute of Nuclear Sciences Vinča](http://bg.ac.rs/en/members/institutes/Vinca.php) in Belgrade. Björn, Helena and Bérénice offered an introductory course to Galaxy and RNA-seq data analysis for the 50 participants. 

Based on the nice feedback we received, all of the participants seem to have enjoyed this workshop.
