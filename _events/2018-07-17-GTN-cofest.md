The Galaxy Training Network has developed an infrastructure to deliver interactive training based on Galaxy: one central place ([https://training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org)) to aggregate training materials covering many current research topics. Each topic is supported by different tutorials developed and maintained by the community via a GitHub repository: [https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material).

The Galaxy Training Network is organizing regular online CoFests (Collaboration/Contribution Fests) every 3 months on the 3rd Friday for a day of the collaborative work on the training content.

The first one will be on the 17th of August. We plan to focus on metagenomics training; but anyone who would like to contribute on any other topics is very welcome to join. We will coordinate via [the GTN Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Contribution+fest%22).

*If you want to join to help or to talk and learn about the project, let us know on the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby).

Bérénice and Saskia will be online between 9am and 6pm (CEST) but people from other time zones should feel welcome to continue even before/after. We will keep an eye on Gitter and GitHub*
