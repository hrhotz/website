The Galaxy Training Network is organizing online CoFests (Collaboration/Contribution Fests) every 3 months for a day of the collaborative work on the training content. **The next one will be on the 21st of February.** Anyone who would like to contribute on any other topics is very welcome to join. During the day, we will also have **GTN community calls** to discuss the recent changes and future directions.
