The Galaxy Training Network is organizing every 3 months one day dedicated to the training community: collaborative work on the training content but also calls with the community. **The next one will be on the 21st of November.** Anyone who would like to contribute, learn how to contribute to the Galaxy Training Material or just catch up with the community is very welcome to join.
