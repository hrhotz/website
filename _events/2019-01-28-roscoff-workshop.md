The [ELIXIR Galaxy Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/galaxy) organizes a 4-days workshop at Roscoff (France) related to Galaxy tool integration and training.

During the first day, the attendees will learn about the integration of high-quality tools within Galaxy with their dependencies ([Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/), [Planemo](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) using the IUC best practice guidelines. They will also learn how to use Galaxy as a training tool and develop training material for the [Galaxy Training Network](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/).

The second half of the workshop will be dedicated to Hackathon sessions where attendees will be able to bring their own projects around tool integration and/or training material and develop them collaboratively, with the support of community experts.

This workshop is organized mostly for developers, computer scientists and bioinformaticians.
