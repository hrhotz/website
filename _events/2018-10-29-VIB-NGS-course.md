**Intended Audience**

Biologists and other life science researchers who would like to use Galaxy for NGS analysis.

No prior bioinformatics or programming knowledge is required.

**Learning Outcomes**

This training aims to familiarise you with the Galaxy user interface. As an example, we will perform a basic NGS workflow in Galaxy (RNA-Seq or DNA-Seq), where you will learn how to import data, run tools, work with histories, and create workflows.

This tutorial will use the European Galaxy instance https://usegalaxy.eu/ and you need to create a free account.

**More information**

There will be desktop computers available, but if you like you can bring your own laptop.

This workshop is organised by ELIXIR Belgium, and it is provided for free.
