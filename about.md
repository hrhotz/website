# usegalaxy.eu

Our Galaxy server ([https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu)) is the **biggest Galaxy instance in Europe**, and one of the biggest worldwide.

With this server we provide access to:
- a huge compute and storage resource without any charge
- more than 1000 different, well-documented and constantly maintained bioinformatics tools
- 250 GB per user (500 GB for ELIXIR members)
- free registration

When this effort is combined with our community-maintained workflows and our in-depth training material, it makes up for a truly productive work experience. We believe in enabling everyone to perform reproducible science.

# <i class="fa fa-table"></i> Data Analysis for any Scientist

**No programming knowledge** is required to access Galaxy and its tools with a web browser. It provides powerful data analyses and can replace Excel habits.

The computation is automatically performed on a **cluster and on the de.NBI cloud**. Each user can store **250 GB** (500 GB for ELIXIR members) for analyses (and even more on request).

For advanced users, [https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu) can be **programmatically accessed** via the API to leverage its cluster and data
storage to scale beyond the visual interface and to automate the analyses. Novel analyses can also be developed right in the interface with **Galaxy Interactive Environments**: Jupyter notebooks, Ethercalc, HiCBrowser, ...

# <i class="fa fa-chart-bar"></i> Visualization & Data Interpretation

Publication-ready visualizations can be instantanously generated inside Galaxy. Charts with bar diagram, line charts, box plots, heatmaps, etc, but also scatterplot, Venn diagrams, and even more.

To dig deeper, **interactive visualizations** are available:

- Integrated Genome Browser: Trackster
- Phinch for BIOM files, Circos, JBrowser, IGV, ...

# <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Tools for any Bioinformatics Analysis

More than 1,000 bioinformatics tools can be accessed via [https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu), covering most of the bioinformatics topics:

The tools and analysis pipelines are regularly updated.

# <i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i> Reproducibility & Transparency

The history is the foundation of **reproducibility and transparency** in Galaxy. It capture inputs, parameters, and versions of the used tools. It can be shared with everyone, even outside.

Galaxy provides also a **powerful workflow system**. Workflows can be created by extraction of workflows from histories or from scratch with drag-and-drop. They are downloadable and sharable with everyone, no vendor lock-in.

The thousands of tools are available with fixed versions and are managed by [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/).

4 TB of reference data are available on [https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu) providing access to hundreds of reference genomes.
